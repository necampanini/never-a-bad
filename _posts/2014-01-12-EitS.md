title: Error in the Shell
---

HTML Proofer very interesting concept. Fairly straightfoward to add to it our project! 

- Simple gem addition in our gemfile
- and a little modifying our .travis.yml
- we get htmlproof'ing. 

It broke our travis-ci build because all scripts/things must exit with status 0 to continue. 

The first set of errors mention something about an internal reference to "#" which it didn't like. My solution involves hosing the other posts and just leving this one as a sort of readme. 

  > Hah, an (obvious) Ghost in the Shell reference!

Pushing this up to the branch on our repo now.
