title: Aggregation vs Composition&#58; Part 1 - The Beginninging
---

I've been asked to take some time and do some research on a particular topic. And I'm excited.

The topic at hand is aggregation vs. composition and how they pertain to Object Oriented Programming. I am humbled that my mentors think this a suitable place in my education that I am capable of tackling this exercise. Granted, gathering reseach topics for this particular project was not as daunting as I anticipated. The verbiage used didn't downright confuse me.

So, here's the "official" topic:

> Explore the differences between Aggregation and Composition as they relate to object oriented programming. Which is used more commonly now, and why? What about newer laguages has lead to this development?

Here's how I plan to tackle the research:

  - Gather multiple definitions of both aggregation and composition
  - Review and understand the history of each (obviously easier said than done)
  - Find what languages started to sway convention(part of history review)
  - Hope Fowler has something to say on the matter...

That's what I have as a starting point at least, and it's enough to get started on a few days reading, considering I have multiple projects/learnings on my plate. Of course I'll be revising these topics and will eventually create an outline of how I want to present the information.

...But for now these blog posts will simply be to chronicle my fun-time adventures and hopefully reflect on digested information.
